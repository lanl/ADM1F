### Anaerobic Digester Model #1 Fast (ADM1F)

Anaerobic digestion (AD) process converts organic wastes into biogas. Biogas can generate heat and electricity through a cascade of biochemical reactions and has been adapted by various facilities and industries to treat and recover energy from high-strength liquid or solid waste streams. Anaerobic Digestion Model 1 (ADM1) is a mathematical model that describes the stoichiometry and kinetics of the essential biochemical reactions in AD.
