### Anaerobic Digester

Anaerobic digestion (AD) process converts organic wastes into biogas. Biogas can generate heat and electricity through a cascade of biochemical reactions and has been adapted by various facilities and industries to treat and recover energy from high-strength liquid or solid waste streams. Anaerobic Digestion Model 1 ([ADM1](https://iwaponline.com/wst/article-abstract/45/10/65/6034/The-IWA-Anaerobic-Digestion-Model-No-1-ADM1?redirectedFrom=fulltext)) is a mathematical model that describes the stoichiometry and kinetics of the essential biochemical reactions in AD. 

### Anaerobic Digestion Model #1 Fast (ADM1F)

The C++ version of the model is computationally more efficient than its Matlab/Simulink predecessor. We called this version of the model Anaerobic Digestion Model 1 Fast (ADM1F).

### ADM1F_SRT (Solid Retention Time) version

The modified version of the ADM1F includes SRT and other modifications described in the [user guide](https://github.com/lanl/ADM1F/blob/main/adm1f_srt_user_guide.pdf).
