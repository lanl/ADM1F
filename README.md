### Anaerobic Digester

Anaerobic digestion (AD) process converts organic wastes into biogas. Biogas can generate heat and electricity through a cascade of biochemical reactions and has been adapted by various facilities and industries to treat and recover energy from high-strength liquid or solid waste streams. Anaerobic Digestion Model 1 [ADM1!](https://iwaponline.com/wst/article-abstract/45/10/65/6034/The-IWA-Anaerobic-Digestion-Model-No-1-ADM1?redirectedFrom=fulltext) is a mathematical model that describes the stoichiometry and kinetics of the essential biochemical reactions in AD. 

### Anaerobic Digester Model #1 Fast (ADM1F)

The C++ version of the model is computationally more efficient than its Matlab/Simulink predecessor. We called this version of the model Anaerobic Digestion Model 1 Fast (ADM1F).

### ADM1F_SRT (solid retention time) version

The modified version of the ADM1F includes SRT and other modifications described in the documentation.
